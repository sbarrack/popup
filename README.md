This popup only shows once per device. It is mobile first, with a desktop version, and does use JavaScript.  

It is highly recommended you only edit fields in `custom.css` and `custom.js` when making changes to the ad styling and content. Please read ALL of the comments and keep a backup so you can revert any bad changes.
